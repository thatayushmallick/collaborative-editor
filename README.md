+ Built the real-time WebSocket server in Python using asyncio and the websockets library, enabling low-latency
multi-user collaboration.
+ Implemented Operational Transformation (OT) logic in Python to merge concurrent text edits with version
control and operation history tracking.
+ Integrated DNS resolution features using the dnspython library to handle A, AAAA, MX, NS, and TXT record
lookups asynchronously.
+ Developed the client-side application using vanilla JavaScript and the WebSocket API to handle real-time events,
cursor updates, and edit diffs.
+ Visualized client latency using Chart.js for dynamic ping graphs and utilized a custom getCaretCoordinates
method for accurate cursor positioning
